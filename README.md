# How to run

Before starting, ensure sure you have node & npm installed ([guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm))

Then, in the project directory, run:

`npm i`

Finally, to start the web application, run:

`npm run dev`

This will host the site locally at: `localhost:4321` and update as you make changes.
