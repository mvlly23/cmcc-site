<h3 id="rosa-luxemburg-1871-1919-" class="font-heading text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Rosa Luxemburg - (1871 - 1919)</h3>
<p class="mb-2">&emsp;Born on March 5th, 1871 in Zamoshc of Congress Poland, Rosa Luxemburg was born into a Jewish family, the youngest of five children. In 1889, at 18 years old, Luxemburg&#39;s revolutionary agitation forced her to move to Zürich, Switzerland, to escape imprisonment. While in Zürich, Luxemburg continued her revolutionary activities from abroad, while studying political economy and law; receiving her doctorate in 1898. Luxemburg would help to create the Polish Social Democratic Party after splitting with the Russian and Polish Socialist parties over ideological differences (Polish self-determination). </p>
<p class="mb-2">&emsp;Luxemburg left Zürich for Berlin in 1898 and joined the German Social Democratic Labour Party. Quickly after joining the party, Luxemburg&#39;s most vibrant revolutionary agitation and writings began to form. Expressing the central issues of debate in the German Social Democracy at the time, she wrote Reform or Revolution in 1900; against Eduard Bernstein&#39;s revisionism of Marxist theory.</p>
<p class="mb-2">&emsp;Before the first World War, Luxemburg wrote The Accumulation of Capital in 1913; a work explaining the capitalist movement towards imperialism. With the beginning of World War I, Luxemburg stood ardently against the German Social-Democratic Parties&#39; social-chauvinistic stand; supporting German aggression and annexations of other nations. Allied with Karl Liebknecht, Luxemburg left the Social Democratic party and helped form the Internationale Group, which soon became the Spartacus League, in opposition of Socialist national chauvinism, agitating instead that German soldiers turn their weapons against their own government and overthrow it. For this revolutionary agitation, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were arrested and imprisoned.</p>
<p class="mb-2">&emsp;In November 1918, the German government reluctantly released Luxemburg from prison, whereupon she immediately began again revolutionary agitation. A month later, Luxemburg and Liebknecht founded the German Communist Party, while armed conflicts were raging in the streets of Berlin in support of the Spartacus League.</p>
<p class="mb-2">&emsp;On January 15, 1919, Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht, and Wilhelm Pieck; the leaders of the German Communist Party, were arrested and taken in for questioning at the Adlon Hotel in Berlin. While what happened is not known, save for the last sentence, one account is that they were told they were to be relocated; German soldiers escorted Luxemburg and Liebknecht out of the building, knocking them unconscious as they left. Pieck managed to escape, while the unconscious bodies of Luxemburg and Liebknecht were quietly driven away in a German military jeep. They were shot, and thrown into a river.</p>
<p class="mb-2">&emsp;With the finest leaders of the German Communist movement murdered, the gates of rising German fascism opened unhindered.</p>

<h3 id="eduard-bernstein-1850-1932-" class="font-heading text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Eduard Bernstein - (1850 - 1932)</h3>
<p>&emsp;Bernstein was a friend of Engels in Engels’ last years and was named his literary executor. A pacifist-centrist during World War I. Founder of the Independent Social Democratic Party (USID) in 1916, but returned to the Social Democratic Party in 1919. Chief exponent of revisionism and reformism for over twenty-five years, beginning in 1896. Editor and author of Evolutionary Socialism, 1899 among other works. In this work, he developed a theory of the gradual transformation of capitalism into socialism; and coined the famous aphorism: &quot;The movement is everything, the final goal nothing&quot;; believing that revolution was not necessary.</p>

<p class="mb-1"><strong>Phenomena</strong> - </p>
<p class="mb-1">Essentially, what you empirically see in a given moment, without transcendentalism.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/#PhenPhen" class="text-blue-900">plato.stanford.edu</a> : </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&emsp;In a strict empiricist vein, what appears before the mind are sensory data or qualia: either patterns of one’s own sensations (seeing red here now, feeling this ticklish feeling, hearing that resonant bass tone) or sensible patterns of worldly things, say, the looks and smells of flowers (what John Locke called secondary qualities of things). In a strict rationalist vein, by contrast, what appears before the mind are ideas, rationally formed “clear and distinct ideas” (in René Descartes’ ideal). In Immanuel Kant’s theory of knowledge, fusing rationalist and empiricist aims, what appears to the mind are phenomena defined as things-as-they-appear or things-as-they-are-represented (in a synthesis of sensory and conceptual forms of objects-as-known). In Auguste Comte’s theory of science, phenomena (phenomenes) are the facts (faits, what occurs) that a given science would explain.</p>
<p>In 18th and 19th century epistemology, then, phenomena are the starting points in building knowledge, especially science. Accordingly, in a familiar and still current sense, phenomena are whatever we observe (perceive) and seek to explain.</p>

<p class="mb-1"><strong>Scientific Socialism</strong> - </p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.prolewiki.org/wiki/Scientific_socialism" class="text-blue-900">prolewiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&emsp;Scientific socialism, a term popularized by Friedrich Engels in the 1800s, refers to an application of socialism that is scientific in nature, and therefore follows the philosophy of Marxism as science is inseparable from socialism, and socialism is inseparable from science. The phrase rose to prominence to distinguish from utopian socialism, which has become a pejorative used to imply naïveté. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You leave behind utopian socialism by being grounded in materialism, marxist economics, and an understanding of class struggle. </p>
<br />
<p class="mb-1"><strong>Cartel</strong> - </p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.prolewiki.org/wiki/Cartel" class="text-blue-900">prolewiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&emsp;Cartels are imperialist financial associations that divide the world between monopolist corporations. [1] Cartels are formed by corporations to limit competition and increase prices by creating artificial shortages through low production quotas, stockpiling, and marketing quotas. This is done to destabilize other, often smaller, companies in the market, as to allow for a small group of companies to have unparalleled monopolistic control. </p>
